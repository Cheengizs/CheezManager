## About the Project

Task Manager is a cross-platform application for organizing daily activities and tracking progress.  
Key features include:

- **Binary tasks** – mark simple tasks as complete (e.g., “Take a shower”).
- **Progress tasks** – track incremental goals (e.g., “Do 100 push-ups”).
- Clean architecture with a .NET backend and React frontend.
- Flexible database design supporting categories, tags, and recurring tasks.
